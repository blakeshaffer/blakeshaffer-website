Recently released data from Statistics Canada allows us to explore demographic trends in the age make-up of the Canadian population. The trend is clear: Canada is getting old.

In this chart-blog, we will take a look at population by age group -- both across regions and over time -- and how median age has evolved. (Spoiler: It's risen. A lot!)
