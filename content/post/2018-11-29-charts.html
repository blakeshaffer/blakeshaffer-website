<p>I like to make charts.</p>
<p>I often post them on Twitter (<span class="citation">@bcshaffer</span>). I thought I might start posting some of them on my website as a way for me to (a) learn to use R Markdown and (b) share some of my R code that creates these charts for others who are interested in learning.</p>
<p>Note: Both my R code and especially my nascent R Markdown skills are still rough. I’m sure much of it isn’t “best practice”. Far from it. It’s what I like to call ‘gets it done’ code. So learn what you can, and apologies for creating bad habits!</p>

<p><strong>Resources:</strong></p>
<p>I learned R primarily from Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund’s book: <a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/">R for Data Science</a>. I highly recommend it. It assumes zero previous R knowledge, even guiding you through where to download the required software, and gets you up and running in no time.</p>
<p>For data visualization tips, I really like Claus Wilke’s online book: <a href="https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/">Fundamentals of Data Visualization</a> (with code examples!).</p>
