<p>Recently released data from Statistics Canada allows us to explore demographic trends in the age make-up of the Canadian population. The trend is clear: Canada is getting old.</p>
<p>In this chart-blog, we will take a look at population by age group – both across regions and over time – and how median age has evolved. (Spoiler: It’s risen. A lot!)</p>
<p>You can find the chart-blog <a href="/post/compiled/Population-pyramids.html">here</a></p>
